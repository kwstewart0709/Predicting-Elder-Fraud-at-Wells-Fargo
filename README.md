Project Description
Banks are required to report suspected vulnerable financial exploitation. Today, much of this
activity is limited to human interaction (bankers working with customers on the phone or in
person), through which bankers may pick up queues, or red flags or customers self-reporting
scams or financial abuse to their financial institution. Digital payments have a degree of reported
fraud and claims, with the assumption that much more unreported losses occur, especially
perpetrated against older adults (60 years of age or older)
